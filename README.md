# tupin
A scripting language for generating sample inputs like a hot knife through butter.       

### Example (now project goal)   

**Problem:** *[1000 - Greetings from LightOJ](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1000)*

**Input Description:**     
Input starts with an integer T (â‰¤ 125), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with a line containing two integers a and b. a denotes the number of problems in the first computer and b denotes the number of problems in the second computer. You can safely assume that a and b will be non-negative and not greater than 10.

**Sample Input:**   
```
2
1 7
9 8
```   

***tupin*** **code**     
```c++
T = rand(0,125)
['T'\n]
for x range(1,T) {
['rand(0,10)' 'rand(0,10)'\n]
}
```

**Explanation**     

Here, each third brackets pair is a print command which prints the content inside the brackets exactly as it appears.

`rand` is a function which returns a random value.

You can use single quotes inside third brackets to execute a code and print it. Similarly the variable T was printed.

`for` indicates the start of a loop. Next variable should be a range to loop (like python except it is inclusive).

All statements are in a single line. Curly brackets indicates a complex statement of multiple statements.
