*[1002 - Country Roads](http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1003)*

**Input Description:**    
Input starts with an integer T (≤ 50), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10000). 
Each of the next m lines will contain two names each in the format a b, 
denoting that you must have a before having b. 
The names will contain at most 10 characters with no blanks.

**Sample Input:**
```
2
2
soda wine
water wine
3
soda wine
water wine
wine water
```

***tupin*** **code** 
```c++
rx = '[a-z]+'   // compile and assign the regular expression to variable rx.
def gen() {
  len = rand(1, 10)
  return randrx(len, rx)  // generates random string of len length from regular expression.
}

T = rand(1,50)
['T']
for range(T-1) {
  m = rand(1,10000)
  [\n'm']
  for range(m-1) : [\n'gen()' 'gen()']     // single line for statement
}
```

*This is just a demonstration. There was no need to use function here.*
